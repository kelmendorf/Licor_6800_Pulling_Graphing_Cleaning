# Licor_6800_Pulling_Graphing_Cleaning_fitACi

This R code pulls data from Licor 6800, cleans data, performs basic statistical analysis, and graphs ACi curves. 
All data was downloaded and compiled into folders on desktop. 
All filenames in folder were edited to be the same for ease of manipulating file names into columns.
Two data uploads were performed for June and August data because desired header lines began on different rows for respective months

This data uses "fitaci" from the plantecophys R package to find Jmax and Vcmax. 
Also includes code to find Amax
